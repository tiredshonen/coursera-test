  		<br>
  		<p>During the start of California’s safer-at-home order in March, I did what many other quarantined-teens did: I finally cleaned out my room for once. I emptied my steel dresser of English vocabulary homework from freshman year of high school, dried-up highlighters and markers that have not been used since God knows how long, and old free T-shirts you get at volunteering events. (But I have to admit: they’re fire pajamas, though). Everything was thrown into trash bags and were either dumped of recycled. Sorry to the garbage workers for dealing with the umpteenth bag of lockdown litter. </p>
  		 
  		<p>However, under all the detritus in my several junk drawers was my old fourth generation iPod Touch. Kept in a rubber, Gameboy-style case and its horribly cracked screen, my iPod held many parts of my being: cringey selfies I took to update my juvenile Facebook account which I lied about my age, the iOS 6 YouTube App where I would watch 240p Naruto episodes cut into 6 parts, and my music library. Eager to dig up my 10-year-old self, I was disappointingly met with a completely wiped-clean iPod. Damn, I really wanted to roast the younger me, but that task can be done if you open a photo album from that era though. </p>

  		<p>Despite not having any physical evidence of the incredible music taste I had in elementary-going-into-middle school, I can clearly recall some songs in my Top 25 playlist (We’ll get to some in a bit). However, encountering my old iPod brought about some complex yet interesting self-reflection that I wouldn’t have done. </p>

  		<p>Since chucking my iPod away into the abyss of my messy drawers, I have graduated from high school and was coming up on finishing my second year of college. I have met so many amazing people that have catapulted me into a beautiful personal transformation—some shit you see in a Netflix coming-of-age teen drama comedy. I would like to think, no, I <strong>know</strong> that I have grown immensely as a student, as a friend, as a son, and as a person. Now that I’m emotionally mature to process my turbulent childhood and articulate enough to pen my thoughts into words, let’s take a look at some of the women who raised me. </p>

  		<p align=left>I particularly emphasize the fact that is it <strong>women</strong> who raised me. I don’t necessarily know why I primarily listened to female artists when I was younger. Maybe it was the absence of a father figure for most of my upbringing, maybe it was just a pure inclination towards a female voice. One thing I know for certain, however, is that many things I have learned came from women.</p>

  		<p>My first ever friend was a girl in kindergarten named Faith who taught me that playing “house” was not a “girl” thing. My first “crush” (young Thomas confused admiration with having a crush) was on someone in sixth grade who helped me slowly overcome body-image issues until I was ready to wear shorts to school. Before, I only wore long jeans to hide my legs. My best friends in middle school, high school, and now college, have guided me and taught me so many things that my lexicon of adjectives will never be able to describe them. They know who they are. </p>

  		<p>On the flip-side, when I’m not with these people, 10-year-old Thomas usually had earphones stuck in his ears most of the time. How some things don’t change. These are some of the songs he listened to. </p>

				<p>Now, 10-year-old Thomas did not know the trials and tribulations of going through a breakup with a toxic partner. My main
          concern at the time was bringing Yu-Gi-Oh cards to school and hiding it from my teachers. Yet, this song--to a naive me--taught me a lot about independence and confidence. Although I did not know what love really meant in elementary school, Aretha Franklin's message of:</p>

        <p>"A rose is still a rose/
          Baby girl, you're still a flower/
          He can leave you and then take you/
          Make you and then break you/
          Darlin', you hold the power."</p>

        <p>taught me a lot about seeking personal refuge in myself irrespective of others' opinions about me. And that message
          was something that I really needed at such a tumultuous period in my life.</p>

        <p>It is IMPOSSIBLE to be an Asian kid in the late 2000's without hearing about the ultimate Korean girl group 2NE1. Although
          I did not understand Korean, seeing Asian musicians achieve such a high level of artistry was important to a young, impressionable Asian kid. </p>

        <p>I remember being the only person in my school that listened to K-pop, so this pleasure was something I kept somewhat secret. I would run 2 blocks from school to my house whenever 2NE1 released a new music video. That's some intense fandom for a little kid.</p>

      <h2>beyoncé - love drought</h2>
      <div style="float: left; width:35%; padding-top: 0px;">

      <div class="song-description">
        <p>Beyoncé was a household name for me growing up. Well, if you consider the household only me since my parents only listened
        to Vietnamese folk music. However, this Beyoncé--the Beyoncé of Lemonade--came at a later time in my life: my junior year of high school. At this point, I have had my brushes with romance (although they were immature and fleeting), so I at least was emotionally mature enough to understand the themes of the album.</p>

        <p>Her artistic direction for Lemonade was something that kind of precipitated a cultural awakening for me. Seeing Beyoncé interweaving the Black experience into her visuals, songwriting, and overall aesthetic left a visceral mark on my attitude towards culture. If Beyoncé can approach fighting structures of white supremacy in America through art, then I was motivated to do the same.</p>

      <h2>f(x) - 4 walls</h2>
      <div style="float: left; width:35%; padding-top: 0px;">

      <div class="song-description">
        <p>f(x) is PEAK Korean girl group. Their style was a little bit more "quirky", if you will, than 2NE1. Their music was more playful and brighter, so it was a nice contrast to the emotional and bass-heaviness of 2NE1. </p>

        <p>I included f(x) as a slight tribute to the late Sulli, an f(x) member who took her own life after battling online bullying and depression. Her death marked an enormoud cultural shift in how the Korean music industry treats and manages their artists, and it speaks to a larger issue of online harrassment in Korean internet culture. There are some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0eenlKilas" target="_blank" style="color: #eaa852">videos</a> online discussing "hater" culture if you're interested. </p>

      <h2>nao - make it out alive (ft. SiR)</h2>
      <div style="float: left; width:35%; padding-top: 0px;">
        <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0VXinRGqxFxr1BKrOrC9pP" width="100%" height="300px" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>

      <div class="song-description">
        <p>Nao was my favorite discovery in 2019. I was well into my second semester of college, and I was struggling a lot with imposter syndrome, stress, and my mental health. Discovering Nao's album Saturn was a small part of my healing. In Nao's words, the concept behind the album is "Saturn's return": the phenomenon when Saturn returns to its original position at the time of your birth. It marks a period of uncertaintly, personal evolution, and the full rebirth into adulthood.</p>

        <p>Hearing this break down brought me a lot of solace. I'm not the biggest buff on astrology, nor do I believe in it. However, I do appreciate the art of interpreting life through a higher power. That, coupled with Nao's gorgeous writing, guided me a lot throughout difficult times during my first year in college.</p>
